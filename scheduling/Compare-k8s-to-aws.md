# Kubernetes Scheduling Concepts - AWS Analogy

This document maps Kubernetes scheduling features like `nodeSelector`, `taints`, `tolerations`, and `affinity` to equivalent concepts in AWS infrastructure, to help make sense of how Pods are scheduled across nodes in a cluster.

## Mapping Kubernetes to AWS

| Kubernetes                          | AWS Analogy                                                  |
|-------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| Node (in a K8s cluster)             | EC2 instance                                                  |
| `nodeSelector`                     | Placement rules (e.g., deploy app to EC2 with tag `Type=SSD`) |
| `taint` on a node                  | “Deny all traffic unless whitelisted” firewall rule           |
| Pod with `toleration`              | App that can bypass special restrictions (like VPN required)  |
| Pod Affinity / Anti-Affinity       | Spread across AZs, or place VMs near/away from others         |
| `topologyKey: kubernetes.io/hostname` | Like "same host" or "same AZ" in AWS                         |

## 1. `nodeSelector` = EC2 Tag-Based Placement

**Kubernetes:**

```yaml
nodeSelector:
  disktype: ssd
```

> Schedule Pod only to a node labeled with `disktype=ssd`.

**AWS Equivalent:**

> Only launch app on EC2 instances tagged `disktype=ssd`.

This mimics manual EC2 instance tagging and app placement.

---

## 2. Taints = Restrict Node Usage

**Kubernetes:**

```bash
kubectl taint nodes kind-worker2 dedicated=testing:NoSchedule
```

> Block Pods from scheduling to the node unless tolerated.

**AWS Equivalent:**

> EC2 node group only accessible to specific workloads (e.g., via IAM, subnet, or security group).

---

## 3. Tolerations = Allow Access to Restricted Nodes

**Kubernetes:**

```yaml
tolerations:
- key: "dedicated"
  operator: "Equal"
  value: "testing"
  effect: "NoSchedule"
```

> Allows Pod to be scheduled onto a node with a matching taint.

**AWS Equivalent:**

> An app is given permissions or configuration (IAM, VPN, etc.) to access a restricted EC2 instance or subnet.

---

## 4. Affinity = Pod Co-location or Distribution

**Kubernetes:**

```yaml
podAffinity:
  requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
    - labelSelector:
        matchExpressions:
        - key: app
          operator: In
          values:
          - core
      topologyKey: "kubernetes.io/hostname"
```

> Schedule a Pod on the same node as another Pod with label `app=core`.

**AWS Equivalent:**

> Run EC2 instances in the same availability zone or on the same physical host (e.g., EC2 Placement Group - cluster).

---

## Visual Example (AWS-Style)

```
+------------------------------------------------------+
| kind-control-plane (like a bastion or manager node)  |
| - No labels                                           |
+------------------------------------------------------+

+----------------------+   +------------------------+
| kind-worker (EC2-A)  |   | kind-worker2 (EC2-B)    |
| Label: disktype=ssd  |   | Taint: dedicated=testing|
+----------------------+   +------------------------+

You:
- Target worker A with `nodeSelector`
- Block worker B with `taint`
- Allow special apps onto worker B with `toleration`
- Use `affinity` to co-locate Pods on the same instance
```

## Summary Table

| Kubernetes Action        | AWS Equivalent                                                       |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Label a node             | Tag an EC2 instance                                                  |
| Use `nodeSelector`       | Only deploy app to EC2s with specific tag                            |
| Taint a node             | Restrict EC2s for specific workloads (e.g., compliance zone)         |
| Add `toleration`         | Give app permission to run in restricted EC2s (IAM, VPC, etc.)       |
| Pod Affinity             | Launch app on the **same EC2/AZ** as another app                     |
| Anti-Affinity            | Spread workloads across different EC2s or AZs for HA                 |
